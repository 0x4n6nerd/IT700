Hi, My name is Ta-Seen Reaz Niloy. 
My research focus is on 5G/NextG Wireless communication, which includes Dynamic Spectrum Sharing in the coexistence of the 5G system in the 12HGHz satellite band. As a case study, I am now working on building a realistic interference analysis tool for the 12 GHz satellite band coexisting with the 5G system for two different weather conditions (Sunny and Rainy)
