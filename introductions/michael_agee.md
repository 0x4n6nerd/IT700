Michael Agee

Background:  I've worked as a technology consultant for the last 17 years with large global 50 companies.  Mostly focused on IT operations and policies.  Prior to that I worked at pretty much every level of IT included a stint as a CTO of national real estate company.  My recent experience is mostly in Cybersecurity policy across the enterprise, but also have led ERP integrations and datalake developments.  

Department / Year:  I'm a first year PhD student in the Cybersecurity Engineering Dept.  

Research Interest:  I'm interested in cybersecurity policy and technology in manufacturing and critical infrastructure.  I would like to concentrate my research in the Latin American region, but see it as a global issue. 

Goals:  To complete my PhD and help my students and colleagues. 

Post-PhD:  I'd love to teach or consult.  Hopefully I'll sort that out before I graduate.  

Personal: 55, single, father of 2 adult daughters, veteran, just moved to the DMV from Los Angeles.  I enjoy healthy activities and workout regularly.  I'm a bit of a foodie, and love mexican food (there is a whole instagram account that goes with that!). 

Anyone play golf?
